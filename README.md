# Hat-trick
 A prototype of an e-commerce android app
 
 This app was designed voluntaryly for a small business of my friends. The business is based on buying soccer kit from designated wholesale market and selling them to local people through using third party courier. 
 
 The app can only store user information,show some available kits with pictures and have user profile dashboard. The project is not completed and further development will be made in future. 

Info: 
Built on Android Studio using Java language 
Warning: 
The app may not run in some devices due to having some hi-reso pic. Still working on it to fix.
